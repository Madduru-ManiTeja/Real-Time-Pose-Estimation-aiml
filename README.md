Real-Time Pose Estimation

Overview
This project implements a real-time human pose estimation system using a pre-trained deep learning model. It captures video frames from your webcam and annotates them with skeletal connections to visualize human poses.

Requirements

Python Installation (Version 3.6 or above)
Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. This code is compatible with Python version 3.6 or higher.

Install OpenCV and Matplotlib
To install the necessary libraries, run the following commands in your terminal:
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook
Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using:
pip install jupyter

Steps to Execute the Project

Clone the Repository
Open the project link.
Click on the "Code" button next to the "Add file" button.
Select HTTPS and copy the URL.
Open the folder where you want to run the project.
Right-click and open the terminal.
Type git clone followed by pasting the URL.
Press enter.
Navigate to the Project Folder
Open the "Real-Time Pose Estimation" folder.
Open the terminal in this folder.
Type jupyter notebook and press enter.
Open the Jupyter Notebook
Select and open the pose_estimation.ipynb Jupyter file.
Running the Pose Estimation Program

Open Jupyter Notebook
Launch the Jupyter Notebook environment.

Navigate to the Notebook
Go to the directory where the pose_estimation.ipynb file is located.

Open the Notebook
Click on the pose_estimation.ipynb file to open it.

Execute the Cells
Run the cells in the notebook by clicking the "Run" button or pressing "Shift + Enter" while a cell is selected.

Pose Estimation in Action
After running the script, the program will start capturing video frames from your webcam for pose estimation. It will use the pre-trained deep learning model loaded from graph_opt.pb to analyze each frame.

View Annotated Frames
The annotated frames, showing skeletal connections representing human poses, will be displayed in real-time within the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Exit the Program
To exit the program and stop its execution, follow the key press instructions defined in the code (e.g., press 'p').

Clean Up Resources
The program will automatically release the video capture object and close any OpenCV windows after termination.
